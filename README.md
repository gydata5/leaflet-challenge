# Leaflet Challenge

## Overview

This project visualizes earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) using the Leaflet.js library. The goal is to create an interactive map displaying earthquake occurrences worldwide, with markers indicating magnitude, depth, and location.

## Technologies Used

* HTML

* CSS

* JavaScript

* Leaflet.js

## Features

* Retrieves real-time earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON feed.

* Displays earthquake locations on an interactive Leaflet map.

* Marker size represents the magnitude of the earthquake.

* Marker color represents the depth of the earthquake.

* Popups provide detailed information about each earthquake.

* A legend explains the color-coding for depth.

## Repository

GitHub Repository: leaflet-challenge

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/gydata5/leaflet-challenge.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd leaflet-challenge

3. Open index.html in a web browser to view the visualization.

## Data Source

* Earthquake data is fetched from the https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php.

## Assignment Breakdown

Part 1: Earthquake Visualization

* Fetch real-time earthquake data.

* Plot earthquakes on a Leaflet map using latitude and longitude.

* Adjust marker size based on magnitude.

* Use color coding to represent depth.

* Display popups with earthquake details.

* Add a legend for clarity, I used ToogleLegend to make the legend disappear when needed.
